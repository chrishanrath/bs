# Berlin School System: Transition to 7th Grade (Gymnasium)

This document summarizes the "Übergang 7" process in Berlin for the 2026/2027 school year.

## 1. The Preference System (Wunsch-System)
Parents list up to three schools. The order is legally binding and determines the order of processing.

| Choice | Priority | Strategy Tip |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Erstwunsch (1st)** | High | You must register in person here. This is your primary shot. |
| **Zweitwunsch (2nd)** | Medium | Only considered if the school has spots left AFTER all their 1st-choice applicants are placed. |
| **Drittwunsch (3rd)** | Low | The final safety net before district assignment (Zuweisung). |

## 2. Admission Quotas (The 10/60/30 Rule)
When a school is oversubscribed, spots are allocated in three distinct pools:

1.  **10% - Hardship (Härtefall):** For students with specific social or medical requirements.
2.  **60% - School Selection (Selection Criteria):** Usually ranked by the **Förderprognose** (grade average). 
    * *Note:* For Gymnasium, an average of **2.2 or better** is standard.
3.  **30% - Lottery (Verlosung):** A random draw among all remaining **1st Choice** applicants who didn't get in via grades.

## 3. How the Selection Logic Works
It is a common misconception that you compete with everyone at once. 

* **Round 1:** Every school looks at its **Erstwunsch** kids. If they have 100 spots and 150 Erstwunsch kids, they fill all spots using the 10/60/30 rule.
* **Round 2:** If (and only if) a school still has empty spots after Round 1, they look at **Zweitwunsch** applicants. 
* **The Competition:** At your 2nd choice, you are **not** competing with their 1st-choice kids (who are already in). You are competing with other 2nd-choice kids for the *remaining* crumbs.

## 4. Key Dates for 2026
* **Jan 30, 2026:** Receive half-year report and **Förderprognose**.
* **Feb 9–10, 2026:** Registration for **Probeunterricht** (for grades > 2.2).
* **Feb 20, 2026:** Trial lessons (Probeunterricht) take place.
* **March 5–12, 2026:** **Official Registration Window.** Submit forms at your 1st-choice school.
* **June 10, 2026:** Admission letters (Bescheide) are sent out.

## 5. Summary of the "Zuweisung"
If your child is rejected by all three choices, the **Schulamt** (District Office) is legally required to provide a spot at a Gymnasium. They will assign your child to any school in the district that still has capacity.
