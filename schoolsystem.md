# Strategic Guide: Berlin School Transition (Übergang 7) - 2026 Edition

This document combines the regulatory framework of the Berlin Senate with strategic insights from Game Theory to optimize your application for the 2026/27 school year.

## 1. The Core Rules (The 10/60/30 Distribution)
If a school receives more applications than it has spots, it must follow this legal quota:

* **10% - Hardship (Härtefälle):** Specialized social or medical needs.
* **60% - School Selection:** Mostly based on the **Förderprognose** (grade average). 
    * *Gymnasium:* Usually requires < 2.2.
    * *ISS:* Often uses a "Leistungsmischung" (mix of high, mid, and low grades).
* **30% - Lottery (Verlosung):** Random draw among remaining **1st-choice applicants**.

## 2. Game Theory: Choice Strategy
The Berlin system is a "Priority Mechanism." It is **not** strategy-proof. To avoid the *Zuweisung* (random assignment by the district), follow these three roles:

### Choice 1: The "Utility Maximizer" (The Reach)
* **Goal:** Apply to your absolute favorite school.
* **Math:** Even if your child's grades are below the 60% cutoff, you still have a **30% mathematical chance** via the lottery. 
* **Risk:** High probability of rejection if the school is popular.

### Choice 2: The "Anchor" (The Strategic Move)
* **Goal:** Secure a spot and avoid the "scrap heap" of unallocated spots.
* **The Golden Rule:** **Never** put a school as your 2nd choice if its demand is > 100%. 
* **Strategy:** Look for a school with a historical demand of **85%–95%**. These schools are "safe" because they have remaining capacity to look at 2nd-choice applicants.

### Choice 3: The "Safety Net" (Risk Mitigation)
* **Goal:** Prevent the Senate from sending your child to a school on the other side of the city.
* **Strategy:** Choose a solid school (often an ISS) that is historically under-subscribed.

## 3. Gymnasium vs. Sekundarschule (ISS)
| Feature | Gymnasium | ISS (with Oberstufe) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Duration** | 6 Years (G8 - Abitur in Grade 12) | 7 Years (G9 - Abitur in Grade 13) |
| **Selection** | Purely by grades (Förderprognose) | Performance Mix (Leistungsmischung) |
| **Pace** | Faster, more academic pressure | Slower, one extra year for Abitur |
| **Demand** | Very high in central districts | Extremely high for G9 path |

## 4. Key Data Resources (Historical Demand)
Check these links to see if your target school is oversubscribed. If "Anmeldungen" > "Plätze", do not use it as a 2nd choice.

* **Gymnasiums:** [gymnasium-berlin.net/nachfrage](https://www.gymnasium-berlin.net/nachfrage)
* **Sekundarschulen:** [sekundarschulen-berlin.de/statistik/nachfrage](https://www.sekundarschulen-berlin.de/statistik/nachfrage)

## 5. Critical 2026 Deadlines
* **Feb 9–10, 2026:** Registration for *Probeunterricht* (if grades are 2.3 or higher and you want Gymnasium).
* **March 5–12, 2026:** **Primary Registration Period.** You must hand in the "Anmeldebogen" at your 1st-choice school.
* **June 10, 2026:** The "Bescheid" (Results) are mailed out.

## 6. The "Zuweisung" Warning
If you list three ultra-popular schools and get rejected by all of them, the **Schulamt** will assign your child to any school with a vacant spot. This is often a school with low demand, poor reputation, or a very long commute. **Your 2nd choice is your most important insurance policy.**
